# Tokenizer Design for Enhanced TTS

This document outlines the design and functionality of a novel tokenizer aimed at improving the performance and control of text-to-speech (TTS) systems. The tokenizer integrates multi-level text analysis, sentiment/prosody encoding, and potential audio-text alignment during training.

## Proposed Tokenizer Functionality

1.  **Multi-Level Text Analysis:**
    * **Sentence-Level Analysis:** The tokenizer identifies sentence boundaries and structural elements (e.g., questions, exclamations) to capture high-level context.
    * **Word/Phrase Analysis:** The tokenizer recognizes common words, phrases, and sentiment-bearing expressions, encoding them as distinct tokens.
    * **BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding):** BPE is used for out-of-vocabulary words and subword patterns, ensuring robustness.
2.  **Contextual Encoding:**
    * The tokenizer considers surrounding sentences and paragraph-level context to refine tokenization and encode contextual information.
3.  **Sentiment/Prosody Tokens:**
    * Special tokens are generated to represent sentiment and prosody features, such as:
        * **Emotion Tokens:** `[EMO_HAPPY]`, `[EMO_SAD]`, `[EMO_ANGRY]`, `[EMO_NEUTRAL]`, `[EMO_EXCITED]`, `[EMO_CALM]`.
        * **Prosody Tokens:** `[PROS_HIGH_PITCH]`, `[PROS_LOW_PITCH]`, `[PROS_FAST_SPEED]`, `[PROS_SLOW_SPEED]`, `[PROS_EMPHASIS]`.
        * **Punctuation/Capitalization Tokens:** `[CAP_ALL]`, `[PUNCT_EXCLAMATION]`, `[PUNCT_QUESTION]`.
4.  **Audio-Text Alignment (Optional Training):**
    * If audio data is available during training, the tokenizer attempts to learn acoustic-related patterns.
    * This might involve:
        * Extracting acoustic features (e.g., mel-spectrograms) from the audio.
        * Aligning text tokens with corresponding acoustic features.
        * Generating tokens that represent acoustic patterns.
5.  **Output:**
    * The tokenizer outputs a sequence of tokens that encode text, context, sentiment, and prosody.
    * These tokens are designed to be directly mapped to mel-spectrograms by a subsequent neural network.

## Training Process

1.  **Data Preparation:**
    * A mixed dataset of text-only and text-audio data is used.
    * Text-audio data includes aligned audio clips and transcripts.
    * Text-only data includes large amounts of text for general language learning.
2.  **Tokenization Rules:**
    * Rules are defined for sentence, word/phrase, and BPE tokenization.
    * Rules are also created to identify sentiment and prosody indicators in the text.
3.  **Acoustic Feature Extraction (Optional):**
    * If audio data is available, acoustic features are extracted and aligned with the text.
4.  **Tokenizer Training:**
    * The tokenizer is trained to:
        * Accurately tokenize text based on defined rules.
        * Generate appropriate sentiment and prosody tokens.
        * (Optional) Align text tokens with acoustic features.
5.  **Tokenizer Output:**
    * The trained tokenizer produces a vocabulary file and tokenization rules.

## Benefits

* **Simplified TTS Neural Network:** The neural network primarily maps tokens to mels, reducing its complexity.
* **Enhanced Prosody and Sentiment Control:** Special tokens allow for fine-grained control over speech output.
* **Robustness:** Multi-level tokenization handles text variations effectively.
* **Potential Efficiency:** Direct token-to-mel mapping can improve inference speed.

## Challenges

* **Tokenizer Training Complexity:** Training the tokenizer to capture acoustic patterns is the main challenge.
* **Acoustic Feature Extraction and Alignment:** Developing robust methods for these tasks is essential.
* **Generalization:** Ensuring the tokenizer generalizes to unseen data is critical.
* **Token Design:** Choosing effective special tokens is crucial.
